GET_NEXT_LINE 42 Project

This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from the file descriptor.

I've learned alot from this project as it deepens my understanding on allocating memory space and how to properly free them after.
I am now pretty good at using GDB and Valgirnd to figure out the issue with my code :)
